## en_GB-large.txt

Copy of the English wordlist, as a placeholder until a wordlist is found for this language (the wordlist is used to detect spelling errors, and ERRANT's error typing is not yet used for languages other than English, so the use of an English wordlist does no harm at the moment).

_Note that the support for languages other than English is only approximate (e.g. we are still using the Lancaster stemmer for English, in the absence of knowing about stemmers for other languages. Feel free to inform!)_
